# Story 3.4: Animation Polish & Performance Optimization

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Favorites & Polish  
**Story ID:** 3.4  
**Created:** 2025-12-03  
**Status:** Draft  

---

## Story

As a **user**,  
I want **smooth, performant animations that enhance the experience**,  
so that **the app feels fast and responsive on all devices**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All animations consistently run at 60fps on modern devices
2. Page transitions refined and consistent throughout app
3. Loading states use elegant skeleton screens or subtle loaders
4. Micro-interactions added to all clickable elements
5. Pull-to-refresh gesture implemented on mobile for data refresh
6. Weather data updates animate smoothly (no jarring changes)
7. Scroll animations optimized (parallax or fade effects if appropriate)
8. Animation performance tested on mid-range mobile devices
9. Reduced motion preferences fully respected across all animations
10. Animation timing functions tuned for natural feel
11. Bundle size checked (Lottie animations optimized/compressed)
12. Code splitting ensures animations don't block initial load

## Tasks

### Task 1: Audit All Animations - Measure current animation performance, identify bottlenecks, test on mid-range devices
### Task 2: Optimize Animation Performance - Use GPU-accelerated properties only, reduce complexity where needed, implement code splitting
### Task 3: Refine Page Transitions - Ensure consistent timing and easing, smooth entrance/exit animations
### Task 4: Polish Loading States - Replace abrupt loaders with elegant skeletons, coordinate loading across components
### Task 5: Add Pull-to-Refresh - Implement mobile gesture for data refresh, visual feedback during pull
### Task 6: Optimize Bundle Size - Compress Lottie files, lazy load animations, analyze webpack bundle
### Task 7: Create Performance Tests - Measure frame rate, test on real devices, ensure 60fps target met

## Dev Notes

**Target:** 60fps on iPhone 8 / Pixel 3 equivalent. **Tools:** Chrome DevTools Performance panel, Lighthouse. **Bundle Size:** Keep animation assets < 500KB total.

---

## Testing

Performance benchmarks, frame rate measurements, bundle size analysis, real device testing.

**Coverage:** 85%+
